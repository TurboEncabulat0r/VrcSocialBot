# VrcSocialBot

This is my attempt at making a bot that is able to hold conversations with people using ChatGPT and speech to text
to run it make sure you have alll the dependencies installed.

for this you will need to allow the speech recognition plugin detect vrc audio as a mic. i achived this using a virtual audio cable
youll also need to set the pygame output source to a virtual mic. i used voicemod for this. but theres probably a better way

other than that its a little scuffed at the moment so ill be working on this in the future more.
